Formal modeling with Hybrid Stochastic Representations

This repository contains some inital versions of Formally founded Hybrid stochastic formalism for modeling SoS Architectures

The syntax and semantics are based on process algebras whihc are embedded into EBNF. Extneded syntax and semantics are inspeired by exisitng formal modeling descriptions for Software Architecture Modleing

A model dirven approach is used based Eclipse Modeling Framework using tools like Xtext and Xtend based on JAVA
