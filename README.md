Formal modeling with Hybrid Stochastic Representations

This repository contains some initial versions of Formally founded Hybrid stochastic formalism for modeling SoS Architectures.

The syntax and semantics are based on process algebras, which are embedded in EBNF using Model-Driven Engineering. Extended syntax and semantics are inspired by existing formal modeling descriptions for Software Architecture Modeling.

A model-driven approach is used based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) using tools like Xtext and Xtend based on JAVA.
